-   Should consist of...
    -   a button that toggles visibility of the content's visibility
    -   the dropdown content itself
-   Button typically only triggers visibility of the dropdown content
-   Dropdown contents should typically only contain items that will trigger an action upon clicking them
-   Actions can include things like "Edit", "Copy", "Delete", links, etc.
-   Visibility can be triggered by click or hover
-   Hard-code menu items in HTML but hide/show using JS
-   JS should be reusable such that you can create multiple dropdowns on a page in HTML
-   Bundle code into a module and publish package to npm
    -   Then you can install it anytime you'd like
